                Kasaroam is an AI-powered platform designed by a group of students from LBS College of Engineering, Kasaragod, to enhance the travel experience of visitors to the district. The platform provides real-time event updates, detailed insights into both popular and lesser-known destinations, and an introduction to the region’s traditional culinary delights.

                As part of the All India Rural-Agri Tech Hackathon organized at Central University of Kerala under the Rural India Business Conclave (RIBC) 2024, the LBS College of Engineering team—comprising Yadumithra U N, Vishal Kodoth, Mohammed Zain, and Sanjay K P, secured a place among the top five finalists. Their idea, Kasaroam, was presented in the grand finale, inspiring them to transform it into a startup.

                Using AI-powered image recognition, Kasaroam allows tourists to explore and understand the rich cultural heritage of the region, including traditional art forms like Theyyam. Additionally, the platform plays a key role in marketing and promoting Kasaragod Sarees, a treasured handloom tradition with over 200 years of rich cultural heritage, helping it reach a wider audience and preserve its legacy for future generations.
            </p>

                Kasaroam generates revenue through premium features, including boat ticket bookings, paid promotions, and a credit-based reward system that encourages engagement and experience sharing. These credits can be redeemed for discounts on boat tickets and exclusive offers.
            </p>
            <p>
                By bridging the gap between tourists and the local community, Kasaroam aims to showcase Kasaragod’s cultural heritage on a global scale. By integrating technology and tradition, the platform ensures a unique and immersive experience for travelers while contributing to the overall development and tourism growth of the region.
